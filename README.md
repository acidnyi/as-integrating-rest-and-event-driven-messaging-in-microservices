# üç± Hybrid Communication in Microservices  
### Comparing REST-Only vs Hybrid (REST + Event-Driven) Architectures

---

## Project Goal

This project was developed as part of the **Software Architecture** university course to explore and compare two architectural communication styles:

1. **Pure REST (Synchronous)** ‚Äì all services communicate via direct HTTP calls.  
2. **Hybrid (REST + Event-Driven)** ‚Äì critical workflows use REST, while background or non-critical operations use asynchronous message passing.

## Project Description

The system models a small **Food Ordering Platform** consisting of independent microservices:
- **Menu Service** ‚Äì provides product catalog and prices.
- **Orders Service** ‚Äì handles order creation and orchestrates the workflow.
- **Payments Service** ‚Äì simulates authorization and payment confirmation.
- **Notifications Service** ‚Äì sends confirmation messages to users.
- **API Gateway** ‚Äì entry point for clients, routing requests to appropriate services.

Two architectural variants are implemented:
- **`/rest`** ‚Äì all interactions are synchronous REST calls.  
- **`/rest+`** ‚Äì a hybrid model where `Orders` communicates with `Payments` via REST and publishes domain events (e.g. `OrderConfirmed`) for asynchronous consumers (`Notifications`).
